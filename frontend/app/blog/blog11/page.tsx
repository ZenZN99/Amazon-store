              transformation by selling goods or services online to customers
              outside a country's borders. Compared to traditional exports,
              e-export websites offer businesses a more flexible, faster, and
              lower-cost sales channel. With an e-export portal , products can

              e-Export Supports
            </h3>
            <p>
              To encourage e-export, the government and various institutions
              offer various support programs to businesses. E-export support in
              Turkey highlights several advantages for businesses. For example,
              the Ministry of Trade provides financial support to businesses
              through digital advertising in international markets, trade show
              participation, and e-export training . E-export incentives and
              support help businesses gain greater international visibility.
              Furthermore, government support for e-export also includes
              logistics and shipping support. International transportation and
              shipping costs are a significant expense for small businesses.
              Therefore, to ensure e-export integration, the government offers
              certain subsidies to streamline cargo and logistics processes.
              Export e-invoices are crucial for businesses exporting
              internationally . With e-export invoices, businesses can obtain
              tax exemptions and incentives. E-export support in terms of taxes
              and incentives can increase their competitiveness in the
              international market.
