              What are the differences between a joint stock company and a
              limited company?
            </h3>
            <p>
              When you look at joint-stock and limited companies as a general
              heading, you can see that both are capital companies. These
              capital companies differ in some respects. Please seek legal
              advice to understand these differences in detail. The differences
              between joint-stock and limited companies can be explained as
              follows: ● Number of partners in a company: One of the most
              important factors distinguishing a joint-stock company from a
              limited company is the difference in partnership size. A
              joint-stock company is established with at least one person, and
              there is no limit on the number of partners. So, how many people
              can a limited company be established with? A limited company is
              similarly established with at least one person, but the upper
              limit is 50. ● Company partnership capital: A crucial difference
              between a joint-stock company and a limited company is the issue
              of capital. The capital of a joint-stock company must be at least
              50,000 TL. The capital of a limited company must be at least
              10,000 TL. ● Partnership Liabilities: Another difference between a
              joint-stock company and a limited company concerns debt. While
              joint-stock companies are not subject to any debt liability,
              limited companies are required to pay taxes in proportion to their
              subscribed shares. ● Share transfer: Another difference between a
              limited and joint-stock company is the transfer of shares. In a
              joint-stock company, the transfer of company shares can be made
              through an externally executed share transfer agreement,
              regardless of conditions such as approval of the transfer, notary
              approval, and announcement in the Trade Registry. Share transfer
              in a limited company is possible only through a notarized share
              transfer agreement, approval of the transfer at the general
              assembly, and announcement in the Trade Registry Gazette. ●
              Requirement to have a lawyer: Another key difference between
              joint-stock companies and limited companies is the requirement to
              have a lawyer. While limited companies are not required to have a
              lawyer, joint-stock companies are required to have a contracted
              lawyer if their capital exceeds 250,000 TL.
