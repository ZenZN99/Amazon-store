              What are the Legal Texts That Must Be Included on an E-Commerce
              Site?
            </h3>
            <p>
              One of the things you need to know about e-commerce is the legal
              documents. E-commerce, a highly popular system in daily life, is
              becoming increasingly popular with the advancement of technology.
              The advancement of technology in this field and the frequent use
              of virtual environments necessitate the inclusion of legal
              documents. An e-commerce site, however, must maintain and
              incorporate these legal documents. The legal documents required to
              be included on an e-commerce site are listed below. ● E-Commerce
              Preliminary Information Form: The e-commerce form is the form you
              see before completing your purchase. The purchase cannot be
              completed, and the purchase cannot be made, without your approval.
              For the purchase to proceed, you must confirm the information
              provided in the form. The form, which appears as a summary of the
              information you enter, is reviewed and approved. The e-commerce
              form is a form that the seller must provide to you. ● E-Commerce
              User – Membership Agreement: This is the agreement that the user
              must accept during the registration process on e-commerce sites
              that require membership and that informs them of their rights and
              responsibilities. ● E-Commerce Privacy Agreement and KVKK:
              Consumers are required to provide personal data in e-commerce
              systems. Information registered in e-commerce systems is crucial
              for privacy and protection. The E-Commerce Privacy Agreement and
              KVKK are legal documents that contain information such as the
              storage and deletion of your shared personal data and provide
              detailed information on many issues. ● Contact Information of the
              E-Commerce Seller: You must have the necessary information about
              the seller of the product you are purchasing. This information
              should be presented in an easily accessible format. The
              information you access allows you to easily contact the seller if
              you have any problems. It plays a significant role in resolving
              issues without resorting to litigation. ● Regulation of the Right
              of Withdrawal in E-Commerce: The right of withdrawal is a right
              granted to cancel or return your purchase within 14 days of making
              an online purchase. The seller must always provide notice of
              withdrawal.

              ranging from your Turkish ID information to bank details,
              depending on the system you're shopping with. In this context, a
              law has been enacted to protect your personal data. Law No. 6698
              on the Protection of Personal Data (KVKK), which is highly
              regarded for its requirements for e-commerce and outlines the

              Disciplining the processing of personal data ● Protecting
              individuals' fundamental rights and freedoms in the processing of
              personal data ● Disciplining the obligations of natural and legal
              persons processing personal data, as well as the procedures and
              principles they must adhere to ● Controlling and protecting the

              violations. These violations can include the unrestricted
              collection of personal data, providing access to unauthorized
              persons, misuse, or indiscriminate unnecessary collection of
              information. Experiencing violations and the resulting
              victimization can be a grueling process. The Personal Data
              Protection Law, which adopts the principle of avoiding this
              grueling process and ensuring that your rights are not hindered,
              is a law based on protection.
