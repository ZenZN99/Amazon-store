              Increasing technological advancements and the opportunities they
              offer are increasing the workforce and fostering an
              entrepreneurial spirit in individuals. To move closer to your
              dreams, you can unleash your entrepreneurial spirit and take a big
              step into the business world by establishing a sole
              proprietorship. By establishing a sole proprietorship, you can
              become your own boss, pursue your interests, and pursue the
              profession you enjoy. Establishing a sole proprietorship to
              achieve your goals is a frequently preferred option due to its
              simple management style, quick setup, and low cost.

              What is a Sole Proprietorship?
            </h3>
            <p>
              One of the questions frequently asked by those wishing to
              establish a sole proprietorship is, "What is a sole
              proprietorship?" The answer is that it's a type of company formed
              by one or more individuals to conduct commercial activities, with
              partners having unlimited liability. A sole proprietorship can be
              formed by a single person, but it can also be formed by a group of
              people. This characteristic gives a sole proprietorship its legal
              personality. If you're looking to own a small or medium-sized
              business, you can choose a sole proprietorship, which is often
              preferred for this purpose.

              What are the Types of Sole Proprietorships?
            </h3>
            <p>
              When you want to establish a company, you'll encounter two types
              of companies: sole proprietorships (sole proprietorships) and
              capital companies. These companies also contain different types of
              companies. Capital companies are divided into three categories:
              joint stock companies, limited partnerships, and limited
              partnerships. These types of sole proprietorships are further
              divided into three categories: general partnerships, collective
              partnerships, and limited partnerships. You can learn more about
              the types of sole proprietorships by reviewing the following
              articles. ● Ordinary Partnership: Also known as an ordinary
              partnership, this is a type of company established by two or more
              individuals. Partners can be natural or legal persons. Partners
              have unlimited liability for the partnership's debts. ● Collective
              Partnership: This is a type of company established by two or more
              individuals joining together to conduct commercial activities. In
              general partnerships established under a trade name, the partners
              are not liable for the company's receivables. ● Limited
              Partnership: This is a type of company formed by two or more
              individuals joining together to conduct commercial activities.
              Partners who are liable for all their assets for debts and
              receivables are called limited partners, while partners with
              limited liability are called limited partners.

              What is the difference between a sole proprietorship and a limited
              company?
            </h3>
            <p>
              There are significant differences between a sole proprietorship
              and a limited liability company, which fall under the umbrella of
              a capital company. If you'd like to learn and examine these
              differences, you can follow the articles below. ● Personal
              liability: While liabilities such as debts, losses, or legal
              claims in a limited liability company are the responsibility of
              the company, you are responsible for them in a sole
              proprietorship. ● Management structure: Limited companies can have
              one or more partners. A sole proprietorship can also have one or
              more partners, but this is not a preferred option because
              transferring a partnership is not an easy process. ● Establishment
              process and capital differences: A limited liability company can
              be established in 2 or 3 days, while a sole proprietorship can be
              established in just one. Establishment costs for a limited
              liability company are higher than for a sole proprietorship, and
              capital requirements are required. ● Taxation: Taxes are lower for
              a limited liability company than for a sole proprietorship.
              Therefore, a limited liability company offers more flexibility in
              tax planning. A limited liability company is subject to corporate
              tax, while a sole proprietorship is subject to income tax. ●
              Prestige: The corporate image of a limited liability company is
              stronger in a limited liability company than in a sole
              proprietorship. ● Management: While certain transactions can be
              handled with a petition in sole proprietorships, this process is
              more complex in limited companies. ● Closing Procedures: While the
              deregistration process for sole proprietorships takes one day,
              limited companies are more difficult to close, with a closure
              period of up to one year.

              Who can establish a sole proprietorship company?
            </h3>
            <p>
              There is an age limit for opening a sole proprietorship, an
              indispensable option that allows you to achieve your goals and
              manage your own business . The minimum age requirement for opening
              a sole proprietorship is 18, which is also required by most
              government agencies. Another obstacle to opening a sole
              proprietorship beyond the 18-year-old age limit is that civil
              servants cannot open one. This is because civil servants are not
              legally classified as merchants. Anyone who is not a civil servant
              and is over 18 years of age can establish a sole proprietorship.
