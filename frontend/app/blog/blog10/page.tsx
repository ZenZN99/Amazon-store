              When shopping online, the question "Is the Import Fee Deposit
              Refundable?" is also a common question. You can find answers to
              the question, "Is the Import Fee Deposit Refundable?" It can be
              said that the fee is refunded to the buyer after customs
              procedures are completed and the actual import price is
              determined. To refund the Amazon import fee deposit , the product
              must arrive in the destination country, customs procedures are
              completed , and the actual import tax is determined. At this
              point, the collected deposit is compared with the actual import

              fee, the difference is refunded. The Amazon import fee deposit

              If Actual Import Fees Are Less or More Than Deposit:
            </h3>
            <p>
              The import fee deposit is collected as an estimated amount. In
              some cases, the actual import fees may not exactly match the
              deposit received. In this case, two different scenarios can occur.
              If the actual import fee is less than the deposit, the excess
              amount will be refunded. This process is subject to a specific
              process. Therefore, you can receive a refund of the overpaid
              amount within 60 days of payment. If the actual import fee exceeds
              the deposit, the seller or platform may cover the remaining
              amount. However, this situation is rare and may not always occur.
